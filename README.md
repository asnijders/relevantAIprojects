# Relevant AI Projects - Ard Snijders

In this repository you can find a small portfolio of some of the AI projects I've worked on in courses from the past academic year. Some of these were group work, but there are also a handful of individual assignments. The purpose of this repository is to provide an overview of my AI skillset, covering programming ability, technical writing, and domain-specific knowledge related to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and more.

# Project Descriptions
In the folder [```Advanced Topics in Computational Semantics```](https://github.com/asnijders/relevantAIprojects/tree/master/Advanced%20Topics%20in%20Computational%20Semantics) you can find an individual programming assignment I worked on for the advanced AI course Advanced Topics in Computational Semantics. Final course grade: 9.

In the folder [```Computer Vision 1```](https://github.com/asnijders/relevantAIprojects/tree/master/Computer%20Vision%201) you can find six lab reports to which I contributed, for the AI course Computer Vision 1. Final course grade: 9.

In the folder [```Information Retrieval 1```](https://github.com/asnijders/relevantAIprojects/tree/master/Information%20Retrieval%201) you can find two programming assignments w/ corresponding reports to which I've contributed, for the AI course Information Retrieval 1. Final course grade: 8.

In the folder [```Deep Learning```](https://github.com/asnijders/relevantAIprojects/tree/master/Deep%20Learning) you can find two solo reports for the AI course Deep Learning (ongoing).

In the folder [```Symbolic Systems 1```](https://github.com/asnijders/relevantAIprojects/tree/master/Symbolic%20Systems%201) you can find two solo reports for the AI course Symbolic Systems 1. Final course grade: 8.5

In the folder [```Natural Language Processing 1```](https://github.com/asnijders/relevantAIprojects/tree/master/Natural%20Language%20Processing%201) you can find two programming assignments, plus a report, which I collaborated on with another student, for the AI course Natural Language Processing 1, for wich we received a grade of 8.2

In the folder [```Computational Dialogue Modelling```](https://github.com/asnijders/relevantAIprojects/tree/master/Computational%20Dialogue%20Modelling) you'll find a paper review, which I wrote for the ongoing AI/Logic course Computational Dialogue Modelling, for which I received a grade of 8.5, and a group report for the main research project of the course, for which we received a 9.
