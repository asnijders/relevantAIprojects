# Relevant AI Projects - Ard Snijders

In this repository you can find a small portfolio of some of the AI projects I've worked on in courses from the past academic year. Some of these were group work, but there are also a handful of individual assignments. The goal of this portfolio is to provide some further proof of my past efforts in AI, in terms of programming, theoretical insights and technical writing.

# Project Descriptions

In the folder ```ATCS-Practical1-ArdSnijders``` you can find an individual programming assignment I worked on for the advanced AI course Advanced Topics in Computational Semantics, for which I received a grade of 8.5

In the folder ```CV1_labs``` you can find two lab reports to which I contributed, for the AI course Computer Vision 1.

In the folder ```IR1``` you can find two programming assignments w/ corresponding reports to which I've contributed, for the AI course Information Retrieval 1, for which we received a combined grade of 9.3

In the folder ```NLP-1``` you can find two programming assignments, plus a report, which I collaborated on with another student, for the AI course Natural Language Processing 1, for wich we received a grade of 8.2

In the folder ```CDM``` you'll find a paper review, which I wrote for the ongoing AI/Logic course Computational Dialogue Modelling, for which I received a grade of 8.5, and a group report for the main research project of the course, on which I collaborated (not yet graded).
