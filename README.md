# Relevant AI Projects - Ard Snijders

In this repository you can find a small portfolio of some of the AI projects I've worked on in courses from the past academic year. Some of these were group work, but there are also a handful of individual assignments. The goal of this portfolio is to provide some further proof of my past efforts in AI, in terms of programming, theoretical insights and technical writing.

# Project Descriptions

In [```grades_ard_snijders.pdf```](https://github.com/asnijders/relevantAIprojects/blob/master/grades_ard_snijders.pdf) you can see a copy of my (most recent) official grades. This gradelist also contains my final grade for information retrieval 1, and will be updated with course results from block 5 once they are entered into SIS.

In the folder [```ATCS-Practical1-ArdSnijders```](https://github.com/asnijders/relevantAIprojects/tree/master/ATCS-Practical1-ArdSnijders) you can find an individual programming assignment I worked on for the advanced AI course Advanced Topics in Computational Semantics, for which I received a grade of 8.5. There's also a poster for the course research project, which was voted as the best-of-class poster :-)

In the folder [```CV1_labs```](https://github.com/asnijders/relevantAIprojects/tree/master/CV1_labs) you can find two lab reports to which I contributed, for the AI course Computer Vision 1.

In the folder [```IR1```](https://github.com/asnijders/relevantAIprojects/tree/master/IR1) you can find two programming assignments w/ corresponding reports to which I've contributed, for the AI course Information Retrieval 1, for which we received a combined grade of 9.3

In the folder [```NLP-1```](https://github.com/asnijders/relevantAIprojects/tree/master/NLP-1) you can find two programming assignments, plus a report, which I collaborated on with another student, for the AI course Natural Language Processing 1, for wich we received a grade of 8.2

In the folder [```CDM```](https://github.com/asnijders/relevantAIprojects/tree/master/CDM) you'll find a paper review, which I wrote for the ongoing AI/Logic course Computational Dialogue Modelling, for which I received a grade of 8.5, and a group report for the main research project of the course, on which I collaborated (not yet graded).

I've also made a repo so you can look at my (homew)work so far for the AI course Symbolic Systems 1, which I'm currently taking. you can access it at:
