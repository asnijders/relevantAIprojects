# Relevant AI Projects

Hi,

In this repository you can find a small portfolio of some of the AI projects I've worked on for the past academic year.
Some of these were group work, but there are also a handful of individual assignments.

# Project Descriptions

In ```ATCS-Practical1-ArdSnijders```, you can find an individual programming assignment I worked on for the AI course advanced topics in computational semantics.

In ```CV1_labs``` you can find two lab reports to which I contributed, for the AI course Computer Vision 1.

In ```IR1``` you can find two programming assignments w/ corresponding reports to which I've contributed, for the AI course Information Retrieval 1.

In ```NLP-1``` you can find two programming assignments, plus a report, which I collaborated on with another student, for the AI course Natural Language Processing 1.
