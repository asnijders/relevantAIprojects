        "In this practical, sentiment analysis was performed on a corpus of movie reviews using two different methods: a symbolic classifyer, and a Bayesian classifyer. The symbolic classifyer assigns classes to documents by use of a sentiment lexicon, where each word in the document is looked up and counts are kept for positive/negative entries. It can be extended with magnitudes, where words with a 'strong' magnitude weigh more than words with a 'weak' magnitude - Theoretically, more information is taken into account, improving accuracy. In line with this hypothesis, enriching the classifyer with magnitudes slightly improved accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Better results were achieved through use of Naive Bayes (NB), which operates on a Bag of Words representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In its primitive form, NB is ineffective because of data sparsity: during testing, the algorithm is likely to encounter unseen words - the conditional probabilities of these words evaluate to zero, rendering resulting predictions unreliable. This explains the poor initial classification accuracy of 50%. Laplacian smoothing was used to account for this. This method deals with data sparsity by redistributing some of the probability mass from common events to rare ones. Applying this technique yields an accuracy of 81%.\n",
        "\n",
        "Arguably, NB outperforms the symbolic classifyer as NB employs a larger feature space (individual words versus lexicon features). A finer-grained approach, NB is able to pick up on more specific facts in the documents, which might explain its better performance. \n",
        "\n",
        "Stemming can be applied before construction of the BoW. Stemming crudely normalizes words by getting rid of different inflections, reducing data sparsity. Applying stemming did not result in a significant difference in accuracy for NB. Possibly, different word inflections do not necessarily encode information relevant to sentiment analysis, and thus it makes sense that stemming does not affect classification outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "A BoW can be extended by incorporating n-grams, re-introducing certain linguistic phenomena that were lost initially when only using unigram features. Theoretically, longer sequences of words encode certain facts specific to the data, allowing for more accurate modelling. Indeed, incorporating n-grams yields a moderate improvement in accuracy, with the combination of uni-grams, bi-grams and tri-grams giving an accuracy of 85%. Adding (higher-order) n-grams significantly expands the feature space. Not only is this computationally more demanding, it can also present problems in terms of data sparsity - generally, adding context is only appropriate if sufficient evidence is present. \n",
        "\n",
        "Words can be augmented with POS tags to deal with polysemy, helping the model to disentangle different meanings of words. In our case, this did not improve accuracy - arguably, different meanings of a word do not necessarily correspond to great differences in expressed sentiment. Alternatively, it's possible that our simplistic implementation of NB fails to capitalize on this information, whereas more sophisticated models would benefit more.\n",

Arguably, the simplicity of both the input data yield limited potential in terms of realizable information extraction.
