Each model and the corresponding code to train and evaluate the model can be found in the file 
with the correct filename:
- doc2vec.py
- LDA.py
- LSI.py
- word2vec.py (word2vec_model.py)
- tf_idf.py

There are some functions that are necessary to load in the data in the correct format and 
generate all word-document matrices and word2id dictionaries. These can be found in:
- data_utils.py

There are also functions that generate a BOW-matrix and TF-IDF matrix without the help of
the gensim library. These can be found in:
- extra_data_utils.py

To generate the average MAP and nDCG results per model and to look up different queries
from the results, we used an iPython Notebook:
- read_data.ipynb


The average MAP and nDCG results for each model  can be found in:
- json_results

The TREC result files for each model can be found in:
- TREC_results
